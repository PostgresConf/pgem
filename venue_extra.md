What to do in Jersey City
-------------------------

**Liberty Science Center**

Whether you’re traveling with kids or if you’re a full-grown science fanatic, LSC has an exhibit, event or show that is right up your alley. Check out the IMAX theater, dinosaur dig, virtual reality and the soon-to-be biggest planetarium in the west. Sign up for a lecture or take a tour through the Center.

**Zeppelin Hall**

This old-fashioned biergarten is the only hot spot on this side of the Hudson or craft beer, good food and a great time. Fill up a stein with one of the 144 brews on tap, grab a bite of traditional European fare from the walk-up window and take a seat at the massive patio’s big community tables.
