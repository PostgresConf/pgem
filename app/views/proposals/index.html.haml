            If you submit a proposal, the conference organizers will review it and either accept or reject it.
            %br
            If your proposal is accepted, the conference organizers expect you to confirm that you will be able to hold it.
            %br
            If your proposal is rejected, you can either live with that or adapt it and resubmit it for review again.
            %br
            If something changes and you can't hold the presentation any more, you should withdraw it.

              Why do I need to add more information?
          %p
            The more information you add to your proposal, the more likely it is that the conference organizers accept your proposal.
            %br
            It will also be more likely that visitors find your proposal interesting enough to attend.

              Why do I need to register to the conference?
          %p
            Knowing the number of visitors for the conference helps the organizers plan better.
